**things you can do!**

- bug fixes, improve code.
- improve documentation.
- write tests
- fix typos

**things to keep in mind:**

- uses [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) for package management and bundling.

install dependencies

```sh
bun i
```

Run example:

```
bun run example
```

this will run a vite server with the example site, which uses the imports
the router from `./src` so it updates with your changes automatically.

run tests in watch mode:

```sh
bun test --watch
```

run dist build

```sh
bun run dist
```
