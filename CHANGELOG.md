## [Unreleased]


## [4.1.0] - 2024-01-06

### Fixed

- Fixed template not rendering when preloading another one.
- x-template.target no longer need the target to be cleared manually if the other routes do not use it.

### Changed

- Changed template rendering method, borrowed from [shaunlee/alpinejs-router](https://github.com/shaunlee/alpinejs-router).
- Changed link handling method, use preact-router's method instead of page.js
- There should be no difference for you as it's an internal change.

## [4.0.3] - 2024-01-03

### Fixed

- Fixed handlers not having access to `this` context when the handler is in an Alpine component.

## [4.0.2] - 2023-12-23

### Fixed

- Prevent reloading on double clicking links. (Fixes #24)

## [4.0.1] - 2023-12-23

### Fixed

- Fixed `fetch-error` event not triggered for 404, 500 responses (Fixes #26)

## [4.0.0] - 2023-11-27

### Added

- Added `x-template` directive replacing the views middleware.
- Added events: `pinecone-start` & `pinecone-end` that dispatch to `document` on template loading, and `fetch-error` on failure.
- Added `cleanup()` for when the route element is removed from the page, it now removes the route as well.
- Added `cleanup()` for `x-handler` and `x-template`, now the handlers and tempate are deleted when the attributes are removed.
- Added `PineconeRouter.settings.templateTargetId` when set all external templates will use render to this element
  
### Changed

- `PineconeRouter.currentContext` is now `PineconeRouter.context`
- Handlers are now **awaited** if they're async, so operations such as fetching will prevent rendering templates and execution of subsequent handlers until current handler is done.
- If a link is a clicked to navigate to a new page while there are handlers active, they will be automatically canceled, the current one will finish running but any ones after will not.
